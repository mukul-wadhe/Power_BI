ANALYZE THE US POLLUTION DATA AND HAVE FOUND FOLLOWING INSIGHTS

Abbreviations: Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ozone (O3), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) The four pollutants (NO2, O3, SO2 and O3) each has 5 specific columns. 

●	State names:  Lists of state names in US

●	State code: Code numbers belongs to each state

●	County code: Unique code numbers specified for county

●	Site number: numbers given to the sites

●	Address: The Address of each locality where pollutant has been detected

●	Country names: List of county names

●	City names: Names of city 

●	Date local: Day Month and the year of every local area when pollutant took place and the hierarchy

●	NO2 units: Units represented by Parts Per Billion, NO2 mean, NO2 1st MAX value, NO2 1st MAX hour, NO2 AQI

●	O3 units: Units represented by parts per million, O3 mean, O3 1st MAX value, O3 1st MAX hour, O3 AQI

●	SO2 units: Units represented by Parts Per Billion, SO2 mean, SO2 1st MAX value, SO2 1st MAX hour, SO2 AQI

●	CO units: Units represented by parts per million, CO2 mean, CO2 1st MAX value, CO2 1st MAX hour, CO2 AQI

Below are the information/demands to be performed in desktop in order to meet requirement:

Page 1: Overview

●	Create text boxes to display all 4 category pollutants and give the action-page navigation.

●	Create Slicers to display states, cities,  counties and so on...

●	Need only the years which has been affected by pollution (you can use a slicer)

●	Create a filled map to show only US States

●	Generate a table display county names along with codes

●	Create Quarter-wise bifurcation of all 4 pollutants. 


Page 2: [Name as Carbon Monoxide] for page navigation and create these below things
